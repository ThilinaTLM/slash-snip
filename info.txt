SlashSnip — Type Less, Write More

Stop typing the same text over and over. SlashSnip lets you create custom text shortcuts that instantly expand into full messages, emails, code snippets, or any text you use frequently.


HOW IT WORKS

1. Create a template with a short trigger (like /sig or ::email)
2. Add your full text content with optional dynamic placeholders
3. Type your trigger in any text field and press Space, Tab, or Enter
4. Your trigger instantly expands into the full text


KEY FEATURES

Custom Triggers
Use any prefix you like: /hello, ::address, //todo, or whatever feels natural to you.

Dynamic Placeholders
Insert live data into your templates:
  • <clipboard> — Paste clipboard content automatically
  • <selection> — Include currently selected text

  • <input:Name> — Prompt for custom input when expanding
  • <select:Option:A,B,C> — Choose from a dropdown list
  • <cursor> — Position your cursor exactly where you want it

Tab Stops
Create templates with multiple fill-in fields. Press Tab to jump between them for quick data entry.
